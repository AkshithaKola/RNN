# RNN

In this assignment we trained different RNNs(Elman network,LSTM,GRU) and compared their performances for the given task.

TASK:Generate a large dataset of samples where each data sample consists of a sequence of variable length, but a constant depth of 2. All values of the first dimension (randomly) lie in [0, 1], and the second dimension being all zeros except for two elements that are marked by 1. Objective of the task is to sum the random values whose second dimensions are marked by 1. Train the different RNNs (Elmon network, LSTM, and GRU) and compare their performance against a baseline that always predicts a sum of 1 plotting the learning curves and final performance.
